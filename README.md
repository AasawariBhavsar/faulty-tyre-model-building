                FaultFindy (Build intelligence using Machine Learning to predict the faulty tyre in manufacturing)


                  Problem Statement
                  
                  The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system using deep learning to predict
                  the faults in manufacturing processes. By analyzing various manufacturing parameters and
                  process data, the system will predict the faulty tyre generated during production. This predictive
                  capability will enable manufacturers to proactively optimize their processes, reduce waste, and
                  improve overall production efficiency.

                  How to run code

                  1. Install following libraries.

                      pip install torch torchvision
                      pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib
                      pip install tensorflow
                      pip install scikit-learn
                      pip install tqdm

                  2.  Create a 'data' folder, extract the zip file into it. (The data size is large, so it's not included in this repository.)
                  3.  Execute each cell individually in the notebook.



                  The project has been deployed, but please note that it may experience intermittent issues due to being on the free tier of AWS.
